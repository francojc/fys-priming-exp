# Masked Semantic Priming Lexical Decision Task (LDT)

## Goal

To demonstrate the concept of semantic priming and how automatic mental associations operate below the level of conscious awareness. This activity shows that briefly presented, unseen words (primes) can influence the speed at which we process related visible words (targets).

## Task: Lexical Decision Task (LDT)

Participants will see a string of letters (the **Target**) appear on the screen. Their task is to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether this string is a real English word or a non-word.

*   Press **'J' key** if the Target is a **real word**.
*   Press **'F' key** if the Target is a **non-word**.

## Goal

To demonstrate the concept of semantic priming and how automatic mental associations operate below the level of conscious awareness. This activity shows that briefly presented, unseen words (primes) can influence the speed at which we process related visible words (targets).

## Task: Lexical Decision Task (LDT)

Participants will see a string of letters (the **Target**) appear on the screen. Their task is to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether this string is a real English word or a non-word.

*   Press **'J' key** if the Target is a **real word**.
*   Press **'F' key** if the Target is a **non-word**.

## Priming Mechanism: Masked Priming

Unbeknownst to the participant initially, immediately before the Target appears, another word (the **Prime**) is flashed very briefly (e.g., 30-50 milliseconds). This prime is "masked" – preceded and followed by a pattern like `#######` – making it very difficult or impossible to see consciously. However, the brain can still process its meaning automatically.

## Conditions

The experiment includes different types of trials to test the priming effect:

1.  **Related Prime - Word Target:**
    *   The masked prime is semantically related to the real-word target.
        *   Example: Prime: `CAREER` (masked) -> Target: `SUCCESS`
            *   *Hypothesis:* This condition should yield the fastest average reaction times (RTs) for correct "Word" responses.

            2.  **Unrelated Prime - Word Target:**
                *   The masked prime is unrelated to the real-word target.
                    *   Example: Prime: `TABLE` (masked) -> Target: `SUCCESS`
                        *   *Hypothesis:* RTs should be slower than in the Related condition. This comparison shows the specific effect of the *related* prime.

                        3.  **Neutral/Unrelated Prime - Non-word Target:**
                            *   The target is a non-word (e.g., `FLIGGLE`). The prime is typically unrelated or neutral.
                                *   Example: Prime: `CHAIR` (masked) -> Target: `FLIGGLE`
                                    *   *Purpose:* These trials are necessary for the LDT task itself, forcing participants to distinguish between words and non-words. They serve as filler trials and ensure participants are paying attention.

*(Note: Non-word targets should be pronounceable but not real words. Some can resemble real words to increase task difficulty slightly).*

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Tool Selection

Choose a platform capable of precise stimulus presentation timing and reaction time measurement. Recommended options:
*   **PsyToolkit:** Free online platform, good for standard tasks.
*   **jsPsych:** Flexible JavaScript library, free, requires more setup (host on GitHub Pages/Pavlovia).
*   **Gorilla Experiment Builder:** Paid, user-friendly web interface.
*   **PsychoPy/Pavlovia:** Free desktop software (PsychoPy) with online hosting (Pavlovia).

*(Avoid using PowerPoint/Keynote/Quarto slides for the actual experiment, as they lack the necessary timing precision for RT measurement and effective masking. They can only be used for conceptual illustration).*

### 2. Experiment Structure (Using a Web Tool)

*   **Instructions Screen:**
    *   Explain the LDT: "Decide if the letters form a real word or not."
        *   Specify keys: "Press 'J' for WORD, 'F' for NON-WORD."
            *   Emphasize speed and accuracy: "Respond as quickly and accurately as possible."
                *   Crucially, **do not mention the masked primes** at this stage.
                *   **Practice Trials:**
                    *   Include 4-6 trials with clear feedback (e.g., "Correct!", "Incorrect!", "Too Slow!").
                        *   Use stimuli different from the main experiment.
                        *   **Main Trials Block:**
                            *   Present approximately 40-60 trials (e.g., 15 Related-Word, 15 Unrelated-Word, 20 Non-word).
                                *   **Crucially, randomize the order of trials** for each participant.
                                    *   **Detailed Trial Sequence:**
                                            1.  Fixation Cross (`+`): Display for 500ms.
                                                    2.  Forward Mask (`#######`): Display for 500ms.
                                                            3.  **Prime Word:** Display for **30-50ms** (This duration is critical and may need adjustment based on screen refresh rates).
                                                                    4.  Backward Mask (`#######`): Display for 100-500ms (Must effectively interrupt prime processing).
                                                                            5.  **Target Word/Non-word:** Display until participant responds.
                                                                                    6.  Blank Screen (Inter-Trial Interval): Display for 1000ms before the next trial starts.
                                                                                    *   **Data Collection:** Configure the tool to automatically record:
                                                                                        *   Trial number
                                                                                            *   Condition (Related, Unrelated, Non-word)
                                                                                                *   Prime word
                                                                                                    *   Target string
                                                                                                        *   Participant's response (key pressed)
                                                                                                            *   Correctness (True/False)
                                                                                                                *   Reaction Time (RT) in milliseconds (from Target onset to key press).
                                                                                                                *   **End Screen:** A simple message indicating the experiment is complete.

### 3. In-Class Execution

*   **Briefing:** Introduce the LDT task based on the instructions screen. Remind students about the keys and the need for speed/accuracy.
*   **Distribution:** Share the link to the online experiment.
*   **Execution:** Allow students ~5-7 minutes to complete the experiment individually on their laptops.
*   **Post-Experiment Check:** Ask the class: "Did anyone consciously *see* any other words flashing very quickly before the main word you were judging?" (Most should report not seeing them clearly).

### 4. Debrief and Reveal

*   **Reveal the Masking:** Explain that a hidden word (the prime) was flashed before each target.
*   **Present Aggregate Results:** Show the class average RTs (anonymous data):
    *   Mean RT for correct "Word" responses in the **Related** condition.
        *   Mean RT for correct "Word" responses in the **Unrelated** condition.
            *   (Optional: Show accuracy rates, which should ideally be high).
            *   **Explain the Effect:** Highlight that RT(Related) is typically faster than RT(Unrelated). Explain *why*: the unseen related prime automatically activated connected concepts in their semantic network, giving a processing advantage for the related target.
            *   **Connect to Theme:** Relate this automatic activation back to how cultural concepts and frequently used phrases (like *mai pen lai*) might shape automatic cognitive responses and mental associations without conscious effort.

## Key Considerations

*   **Timing Precision:** Accurate prime duration (30-50ms) and masking are essential. This relies heavily on the chosen platform and the participants' computer/display capabilities. Test thoroughly.
*   **Mask Effectiveness:** Ensure the masks (`#######`) are effective at preventing conscious identification of the prime.
*   **Stimulus Quality:** Use clear, unambiguous words and non-words. Balance word frequency and length across conditions if possible (though less critical for a simple demo).
*   **Focus on Demonstration:** This is an in-class illustration, not rigorous research. Emphasize the typical *pattern* of results (Related < Unrelated) rather than statistical significance. Individual results can be noisy.
*   **Ethical Note:** Briefly mention that such techniques are used in psychology research to understand unconscious processing, always with ethical oversight.

Unbeknownst to the participant initially, immediately before the Target appears, another word (the **Prime**) is flashed very briefly (e.g., 30-50 milliseconds). This prime is "masked" – preceded and followed by a pattern like `#######` – making it very difficult or impossible to see consciously. However, the brain can still process its meaning automatically.

## Conditions

The experiment includes different types of trials to test the priming effect:

1.  **Related Prime - Word Target:**
    *   The masked prime is semantically related to the real-word target.
    *   Example: Prime: `CAREER` (masked) -> Target: `SUCCESS`
    *   *Hypothesis:* This condition should yield the fastest average reaction times (RTs) for correct "Word" responses.

2.  **Unrelated Prime - Word Target:**
    *   The masked prime is unrelated to the real-word target.
    *   Example: Prime: `TABLE` (masked) -> Target: `SUCCESS`
    *   *Hypothesis:* RTs should be slower than in the Related condition. This comparison shows the specific effect of the *related* prime.

3.  **Neutral/Unrelated Prime - Non-word Target:**
    *   The target is a non-word (e.g., `FLIGGLE`). The prime is typically unrelated or neutral.
    *   Example: Prime: `CHAIR` (masked) -> Target: `FLIGGLE`
    *   *Purpose:* These trials are necessary for the LDT task itself, forcing participants to distinguish between words and non-words. They serve as filler trials and ensure participants are paying attention.

*(Note: Non-word targets should be pronounceable but not real words. Some can resemble real words to increase task difficulty slightly).*

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Tool Selection

Choose a platform capable of precise stimulus presentation timing and reaction time measurement. Recommended options:
*   **PsyToolkit:** Free online platform, good for standard tasks.
*   **jsPsych:** Flexible JavaScript library, free, requires more setup (host on GitHub Pages/Pavlovia).
*   **Gorilla Experiment Builder:** Paid, user-friendly web interface.
*   **PsychoPy/Pavlovia:** Free desktop software (PsychoPy) with online hosting (Pavlovia).

*(Avoid using PowerPoint/Keynote/Quarto slides for the actual experiment, as they lack the necessary timing precision for RT measurement and effective masking. They can only be used for conceptual illustration).*

### 2. Experiment Structure (Using a Web Tool)

*   **Instructions Screen:**
    *   Explain the LDT: "Decide if the letters form a real word or not."
    *   Specify keys: "Press 'J' for WORD, 'F' for NON-WORD."
    *   Emphasize speed and accuracy: "Respond as quickly and accurately as possible."
    *   Crucially, **do not mention the masked primes** at this stage.
*   **Practice Trials:**
    *   Include 4-6 trials with clear feedback (e.g., "Correct!", "Incorrect!", "Too Slow!").
    *   Use stimuli different from the main experiment.
*   **Main Trials Block:**
    *   Present approximately 40-60 trials (e.g., 15 Related-Word, 15 Unrelated-Word, 20 Non-word).
    *   **Crucially, randomize the order of trials** for each participant.
    *   **Detailed Trial Sequence:**
        1.  Fixation Cross (`+`): Display for 500ms.
        2.  Forward Mask (`#######`): Display for 500ms.
        3.  **Prime Word:** Display for **30-50ms** (This duration is critical and may need adjustment based on screen refresh rates).
        4.  Backward Mask (`#######`): Display for 100-500ms (Must effectively interrupt prime processing).
        5.  **Target Word/Non-word:** Display until participant responds.
        6.  Blank Screen (Inter-Trial Interval): Display for 1000ms before the next trial starts.
*   **Data Collection:** Configure the tool to automatically record:
    *   Trial number
    *   Condition (Related, Unrelated, Non-word)
    *   Prime word
    *   Target string
    *   Participant's response (key pressed)
    *   Correctness (True/False)
    *   Reaction Time (RT) in milliseconds (from Target onset to key press).
*   **End Screen:** A simple message indicating the experiment is complete.

### 3. In-Class Execution

*   **Briefing:** Introduce the LDT task based on the instructions screen. Remind students about the keys and the need for speed/accuracy.
*   **Distribution:** Share the link to the online experiment.
*   **Execution:** Allow students ~5-7 minutes to complete the experiment individually on their laptops.
*   **Post-Experiment Check:** Ask the class: "Did anyone consciously *see* any other words flashing very quickly before the main word you were judging?" (Most should report not seeing them clearly).

### 4. Debrief and Reveal

*   **Reveal the Masking:** Explain that a hidden word (the prime) was flashed before each target.
*   **Present Aggregate Results:** Show the class average RTs (anonymous data):
    *   Mean RT for correct "Word" responses in the **Related** condition.
    *   Mean RT for correct "Word" responses in the **Unrelated** condition.
    *   (Optional: Show accuracy rates, which should ideally be high).
*   **Explain the Effect:** Highlight that RT(Related) is typically faster than RT(Unrelated). Explain *why*: the unseen related prime automatically activated connected concepts in their semantic network, giving a processing advantage for the related target.
*   **Connect to Theme:** Relate this automatic activation back to how cultural concepts and frequently used phrases (like *mai pen lai*) might shape automatic cognitive responses and mental associations without conscious effort.

## Key Considerations

*   **Timing Precision:** Accurate prime duration (30-50ms) and masking are essential. This relies heavily on the chosen platform and the participants' computer/display capabilities. Test thoroughly.
*   **Mask Effectiveness:** Ensure the masks (`#######`) are effective at preventing conscious identification of the prime.
*   **Stimulus Quality:** Use clear, unambiguous words and non-words. Balance word frequency and length across conditions if possible (though less critical for a simple demo).
*   **Focus on Demonstration:** This is an in-class illustration, not rigorous research. Emphasize the typical *pattern* of results (Related < Unrelated) rather than statistical significance. Individual results can be noisy.
*   **Ethical Note:** Briefly mention that such techniques are used in psychology research to understand unconscious processing, always with ethical oversight.

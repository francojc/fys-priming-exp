## Introduction

This document analyzes the results of a lexical decision task experiment conducted using PCIbex. The goal is to examine the priming effect, specifically how a preceding related word (prime) affects the reaction time (RT) and accuracy in identifying a subsequent target string as a word or non-word compared to an unrelated prime.

We will perform the following steps:

1.  Load necessary R libraries.
2.  Define a function to read the PCIbex results data.
3.  Load and clean the raw data.
4.  Tidy the data to extract relevant events (target onset, response).
5.  Calculate reaction times (RT) and response accuracy.
6.  Filter the data based on standard criteria for RT analysis.
7.  Analyze the priming effect on RT using descriptive statistics and a linear mixed-effects model.
8.  Analyze accuracy.
9.  Visualize the RT and accuracy results.

## 1. Load Libraries

We begin by loading the required R packages. We use `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization, `janitor` for cleaning names, `here` for path management, `lme4` and `lmerTest` for mixed-effects modeling, and `emmeans` for post-hoc analysis.

+/ask I am aiming to build the experiment described in the `resources/ldt.md` file. Can you help me adjust my stimuli to fit the template/ example provided in `chunk_includes/list.csv`?

# 2025-03-27 17:43:28.781864
+/ask the addition of the `.log("PrimeWord", ...` and TargetWord means that the results will contain these, correct?

# 2025-03-27 17:44:17.515382
+Great. Can you write the stimuli to the new file and adjust the `main.js` to include the prime and target words in the results?

# 2025-03-27 17:47:06.347944
+/ask Now, I isn't it better to have two 'group' labels so that some students will get the related prime-target sequence and other will get the unrelated prime-target sequence, with all the students getting the same non-word distractors?

# 2025-03-27 17:47:31.167829
+Implement this change.

# 2025-03-27 17:49:03.265820
+/ask Hold on, Group A and B should get a mix of related and unrelated prime-target sequences, just not the same ones, right?

# 2025-03-27 17:49:55.461978
+Yes, regenerate the ldt_stimuli.csv file.

# 2025-03-27 22:40:21.732756
+/ask A potential issue is that the `main.js` is not recording a participant id, or is it? 

# 2025-03-27 22:44:05.277914
+/ask I just want to have an auto-generated id so that I can separate individual participants for the lmer analysis. Would it be necessary to also add item numbers/ids for the lmer analysis? Or can this be derived in the `analysis/results.R` script?

# 2025-03-27 22:46:21.831694
+Great. Update the `main.js` file to include the autogenerated participant id and then update the `results.R` file as necessary to add the lmer analysis.
